/**
 * Session feeder annotation marks the injection point where the current user session is to be
 * injected. A user in starts with simulation execution, and ends as soon as the simulation
 * ends. The user sessions are useful e.g if you need a context shared between scenario executions.
 * Test developers might choose to initialize resources in prepare() method, e.g upload a
 * resource beforehand and store the reference of the resource in the session so as to access it
 * in scenario methods.
